ImPACT internship work on curating and modeling the NCI-60 database, specifically with T-47D and MCF7. This repo includes raw and pre-processed .csv, EDA, and some code to perform random forest regression modeling on curated, canonicalized SMILES with normalized gi50 values. Kinda rushed at the end and never converted any notebooks to .py scripts. sorry
